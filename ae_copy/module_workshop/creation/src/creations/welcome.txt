Hello this is the logs section of the app.
Here you can log anything you want and come back to it later to edit as you go.
To start type the file name into the File Name text box then click New File.
It should now show the first log and a box you can type into to insert new text.
Later on you can click the file name and press edit or read to edit or read the file.
